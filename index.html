        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Studying Computer Science with Mathematics Bsc at the University of Leeds, I appreciate the significance of knowledge, and have a strong desire to keep learning in the profession I undertake.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through studying abroad,<!-- I absquatulated my previous life,--> attending summer schools and working in various part-time positions, I developed multi-faceted skills and understand the importance of communication and attention to detail. I take pride in my work, prioritizing that it is clear and understandable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working in a cohesive team is very important to me and I commit to being accountable, fully present and actively involved in incubating ideas generated by my peers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I stay engaged in my passions by staying updated digitally and attending talks when possible. One of my favorite extracurricular courses was "An Introduction to Neuroscience" which explored the brain's intricate workings - something I could talk about endlessly and am eager to keep studying.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main goals are to learn irreplaceable, lasting skills. Learn to create and maintain scalable services. Use tools at the forefront of my industry. Exercise creativity and ingenuity in my profession and to nurture strong professional networks. 
        </p>
